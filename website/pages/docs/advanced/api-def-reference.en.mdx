# API-DEFs reference

`API-DEF` is stands for "API definition". It's a JSON document that describes the API.

The main purpose of `Smupe!` creation is it's ability to provide custom image sources.

I decided to use a JSON documents to define them, and after process inside and alongside the app.

This "module" got a strange name `API-DEFs`, ~~but who matters?~~

API-DEF JSON is basically used to:

* retrieve API links and make requests to them
* define simple schema of each response, at least to get target image
* apply ~~all~~ some of HTTP protocol mess to it
* connect some features of the app with the API response (like Blurhash, Search, Tags)

## API-DEF schema

API-DEF is hidden in app files. As a end user, you proably should not matter about
it's schema. But when you're decided to create own API-DEF, you should
follow the schema below.

### In-app editor fields

This section mentions in-app API-DEF editor and compares input fields to technical name and its values.
